* Verify how GOBject callbacks works:
  * Lists saved as "objects": Is obj in callback a reference to the original data?
  * If a property is set to the same value, is a notification sent?
* Jump to other files if trying to play outside a given file.
  * Threshold when seeking backwards?
  * Snap to beginning of file when seeking forward?
* Simple play at EOB starts playing at beginning of first file.
* Simple console UI.
* More advanced ncurses UI.
* Maybe a simple GTK UI in the future. (Could also be released as a PND.)
* Build scripts.
* Scripts to build .deb.
* Doc-comments!
